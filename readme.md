- Use `npm install` to prepare the _node module_ folder
- create `.env` file for your private **application id**

## Final
- Make sure to have `npm run config-prod` to prepare the **production** folder
- Use `npm run start` to run the application 
- `npm test` can be used to test the _post_ functionality
