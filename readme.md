## Introdcution
This is for Front End Nano Degree within Million Arab Programmers. It's the third project.

## Dependency
- I used [Nanodegree code](https://github.com/tarikgad/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/evaluate-news-nlp) as a starting point.
- I added a field for country code with dafualt value of **us**

## Final
The project has **localhost:3000** as the main url.

[_website_](website/) is the web folder

_server.bat_ will start the **_node server_** directly :)
